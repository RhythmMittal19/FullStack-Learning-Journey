# Zero to Backend Architect: The 3-Year Master Plan (2025-2028)

> **Current Status**: Fresher

> **Target**: 25+ LPA (Product Based Companies / High Growth Startups)


---

## Phase 0: The Foundation (Month 1–3)
*Building the "muscle memory" for coding.*

- [ ] **Language Mastery (The Trinity)**
    - **JavaScript**: [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info) + [Chai aur Code (Hitesh Choudhary)](https://www.youtube.com/c/HiteshChoudharydotcom)
    - **Python**: [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithHarry) / Harshit Vashisth
    - **C++**: [Striver (TakeUForward)](https://takeuforward.org/) + Love Babbar
- [ ] **Data Structures & Algorithms**
    - Goal: Solve **300–350 LeetCode problems**.
    - Strategy: Rotate languages weekly to stay sharp in all three.
    - [ ] Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
    - [ ] Trees, Graphs, Recursion
    - [ ] Dynamic Programming

---

## Phase 1: Core Backend Engineering (Month 4–8)
*Moving from "writing code" to "building systems".*

### 1. The Tools
- [ ] **Git & GitHub**: Professional workflow (Branching, PRs, Rebasing).
- [ ] **Linux**: Bash scripting, Permissions, SSH, Cron jobs.
- [ ] **Computer Networks**: HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, DNS, CDN, Load Balancers.

### 2. The Data Layer
- [ ] **SQL Mastery (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**
    - Resource: Striver SQL 50 + LeetCode Database problems.
    - Concepts: Joins, Indexing, ACID Transactions.
- [ ] **NoSQL & Caching**
    - **MongoDB**: Aggregation pipelines.
    - **Redis**: Caching, Rate Limiting, Session Management.

### 3. Phase 1 Projects (Must Deploy)
- [ ] **URL Shortener**: Node.js + MongoDB + Redis.
- [ ] **Todo API with Auth**: FastAPI (Python) + PostgreSQL + JWT.
- [ ] **E-commerce Backend**: Node.js + PostgreSQL + Redis (Cart logic).

---

## Phase 2: The Primary Stack (Month 9–14)
*The "Employability" Phase. Targeting Swiggy, Zomato, Cred, Groww.*

### Primary Path (Recommended for 2025)
- [ ] **Node.js + TypeScript**: Strict typing is non-negotiable.
- [ ] **NestJS Framework**: The enterprise standard for Node.js.
    - Dependency Injection, Decorators, Modules.
    - *Why? Used by Razorpay, Dream11, PhonePe.*

### Secondary / Elite Paths (Optional)
- [ ] **Java + Spring Boot**: Target Amazon, Walmart, Goldman Sachs.
- [ ] **Go / C++**: Target HFTs and Systems roles (45-80 LPA).

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Architecture & System Design (Month 15–24)
*Scaling to millions of users.*

### 1. Advanced Components
- [ ] **Message Queues**: Kafka (Preferred) or RabbitMQ.
- [ ] **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes (K8s) basics.
- [ ] **Communication**: WebSockets (Real-time), gRPC, GraphQL.
- [ ] **Security**: Rate Limiting, OWASP Top 10.

### 2. System Design (LLD & HLD)
- [ ] **LLD (Low Level Design)**:
    - Resource: Striver + Grokking OOP.
    - Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer).
- [ ] **HLD (High Level Design)**:
    - Resource: Gaurav Sen → Arsh Goyal → System Design Primer.
    - Concepts: Sharding, Replication, CAP Theorem.

### 3. The Capstone Project (The Resume Highlight)
> *This single project can land 25-40 LPA offers.*
- [ ] **Full Clone (Twitter / Instagram / Swiggy)**
    - **Tech**: Microservices + Kafka + Redis + Postgres + WebSockets.
    - **Features**: Feed generation, Real-time notifications, Payment integration.

---

## Phase 4: Mastery & Specialization (Month 25–36)
*Becoming the Top 1%.*

**Choose Your Weapon:**
- [ ] **Distributed Systems**: Deep dive into Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Kafka internals.
- [ ] **Low-Latency Systems**: C++/Go for High Frequency Trading (HFT) or Gaming.
- [ ] **Security**: PCI-DSS compliance, Encryption standards.
- [ ] **Open Source**: Contribute to NestJS, SuperTokens, Hasura, or Cal.com.

**Daily Habit**:
- [ ] Competitive Programming: Codeforces Div 2 or LeetCode Rating 1800+.

## Note to Self
*   **Consistency > Intensity**. It is better to code for 2 hours every day than 12 hours once a week.
*   **Don't stick to tutorials**. Build things that break, then fix them by reading the documentation.
*   **Deploy everything**. Code on localhost doesn't exist to recruiters.
